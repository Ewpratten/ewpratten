## More about me

I have been developing software since the fifth grade, starting my journey with JavaScript and Python. Years later, I am now writing software both professionally, and as a hobby in more languages than I can remember. Having two computer scientists for parents probably pre-disposed me to this honestly. 

Outside of work, I almost exclusively develop open-source software, and it is all available here on this GitHub account. On personal projects, I like to iterate, experiment, and develop as fast as possible, which leads me to have a habit of cranking out projects every three-ish days. A lot of these projects are either developed out of necessity for use in another project, or as learning experiments. Feel free to use, fork, and contribute to any of my projects. I appreciate any feedback given in return.

## Notable past projects

In the past, I have worked on many interesting projects of various sizes. I was once a (very) popular user over on [devRant](https://devrant.com/users/ewpratten), and have worked on multiple bots and statistical tools for the site's community, including my first ever group project, [devCredits](https://github.com/Ewpratten/devCredits), and a command-line client for the app, [dr](https://github.com/Ewpratten/dr).

Neither of those old projects were particularly well designed or written on my part, but I learned a lot from them, and thats what matters in my opinion.

More recently, I have been involved with [Raider Robotics](https://github.com/frc5024), a [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team based out of my highschool. On Raider Robotics, I was the leading force developing the software that powered our award-winning robots: [Q*bert](https://github.com/frc5024/PowerUP), [MiniBot](https://github.com/frc5024/uBase), [HATCHField](https://github.com/frc5024/DeepSpace), and [Darth Raider](https://github.com/frc5024/InfiniteRecharge). I also developed some [event management software](https://github.com/frc5024/ThriftyField), a [parts management tool](https://github.com/frc5024/parts) for the team shop, [hardware debugging tools](https://github.com/frc5024/testbench), and the team's [core robotics library](https://github.com/frc5024/lib5k) (including its [documentation](https://frc5024.github.io/lib5k)).
