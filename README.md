### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Evan Pratten. Here is a bit about me. I am:
 - Lead programmer at [Raider Robotics](https://github.com/frc5024)
 - Intern Pipeline Technical Director at [Industrial Brothers](https://www.industrialbrothers.com/)
 
### My blog :book:

I run a small, tech-oriented blog [on my website](https://retrylife.ca). It is here that I generally do writeups of my projects, and show off my work. Feel free to check it out, and maybe learn something obscure in the process.
